            <p>Full Stack Senior Web Developer with over 18 years of experience. Currently working as a Senior Developer
                at
                a
                B2B SaaS company. Enjoy learning through hands-on work, finding solutions for (not only) tech problems,
                and
                sharing knowledge within collaborative teams.</p>
            <p>Started out of curiosity as a teenager (messing around with FrontPage, Dreamweaver, Flash, and others).
                That
                led
                to my first job as Web Designer, working with tools like Photoshop, Corel Draw, Fireworks and frontend
                development using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Acquired interest in backend by learning PHP from a
                coworker at
                the
                time (2007). After a year, I assumed the role of "Webmaster", maintaining multiple company websites.</p>
            <p>In 2013, I started freelancing, working directly with clients, designing and developing pages. Seeking
                more
                opportunities for collaboration within a team, I joined a small startup in 2018 as a Frontend Developer,
                working
                with React.js for two years. I later took on a role as Fullstack Developer, building applications with
                Next.js,
                Ruby, and Golang, at the e-commerce branch of the multi-platform company where I currently work.
                Recently, I
                have been studying LLMs and using AI agents to enhance solutions and accelerate deliveries.</p>
